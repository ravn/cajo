cajo
====

Cajo is a very simple way to have two JVM's discover each other and communicate across
a local area network.

Cajo was written by John Catherino who died in 2016 without designating 
a future maintainer.  Thorbjørn Ravn Andersen used Cajo for internal 
development in a previous job and mavenized it in 2013 and added a copy
of the java.net resources just before it went dark in 2018. The project was cleaned up then with the intention of getting it on Maven Central, but stranded on first wanting John Catherinos approval and later finding out he had died.

The code is maintained just enough by Thorbjørn that it can compile and build with the latest version of Maven and Java LTS.  Additional work is very welcome.

Note:  If all you need, is an original distribution in Maven then 1.168 was packaged and uploaded to a third party Maven repository at http://nexus.nuiton.org/nexus/content/repositories/thirdparty/gnu/cajo/cajo/1.168/
